## Info

- Current version which was bypassed: 398.0.0 (unreleased, costs money)
- You can now intercept all requests
- iOS Only
- Tested on iOS 15.4.1
- Any support is appreciated
 
## Installation
1. Download the IPA file
2. Sideload the file (I personally suggest [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore))
3. Set up the proxy before starting the app (Was tested only with mitmproxy)
4. Intercept

## Crashing Issue
- Many people experienced crashing after login this is caused somehow by sideloading you have to sideload it using TrollStore to stop the crashing

## What is SSL pinning?

SSL pinning, also known as certificate pinning or public key pinning, is a security mechanism used in digital communication to enhance the security of a connection, particularly within the context of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS).

When a client (such as a web browser or a mobile app) connects to a server over HTTPS, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to prove its identity. Normally, the client verifies the server's certificate by checking if it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). However, SSL pinning adds an extra layer of security by requiring the client to validate the server's certificate against a known, pre-configured set of certificates or public keys, rather than solely relying on the CA's trust chain.
